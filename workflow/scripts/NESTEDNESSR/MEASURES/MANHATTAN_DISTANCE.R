#The Tau-temperature method based on the Manhattan Distance is described in
#Corso & Britton, 2012. This function returns the Manhattan distance of a
#matrix. The Tau-temperature is calculated as the Manhattan distance of the
#test matrix divided by the expected Manhattan distance as calculated from
#the mean of an ensemble. In FALCON the Tau-temperature is shown as the
#NormalisedTemperature in the outputs.
